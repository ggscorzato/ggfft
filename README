This is the README file of the ggfft library

It is a simple parallel FFT library for data distributed on a M-dimensional toroidal network of processes.  It combines a serial N-dimensional FFT (serial_multidim_fft), which is a slight modification of the Numerical Recipes function fourn, together with a generalized transposition (permute), that exchange the data with MPI.  No HW specific optimization is attempted, neither in the serial FFT step, nor in the permutation. I wrote it because I could not find any reliable FFT for a torus of general dimension M in which N-dimensional (N>M) data are distributed.

Compiling the library:
edit Makefile if necessary (compilers etc...)
make

Using the library:
The user should call three routines:
    gg_init(...) once for the initialization
    gg_distributed_multidim_fft(...), which actually does the FFT
    gg_finalize() for clean exit (free the allocated memory)
The user should also include the header file "ggfft.h" and link the executable to libggfft.a


Limitation:
-No optimization on the serial FFT is attempted (basically fourn of Numerical Recipes)
-The serial FFT is limited to data lengths of power of 2.
-communication in permute are very naive: the topology of the torus is not yet exploited.
-dimension of the data should be larger than the dimension of the torus.
