DEBUGGING:
- more tests with strange lattices
- test ordering

IMPROVEMENTS:

1. Substitute the variable _Mail with one which has only size=_volproc.

2. Introduce an init_transpose, to be executed in init to pre-compute the indices:
_idest[seqin]=seqout;
_pdest[seqin]=proc_out;
_ordinpout[seqin]=_kk[proc_out];
foreach needed fft. While the call to transpose only exchanges the appropriate data.

3. call fftw for the serial fft.
